# Devops Jumpbox VM

This VM [builds the terraform provider](../../providers/terraform-provider-avere#build-the-terraform-provider-binary) and comes pre-installed with:
* az cli
* terraform
* jq

This also installs in the `172.16.0.0/20` network to not overlap with the other vFXT and HPC Cache examples, so this can be paired as a type of onprem node.

## Deployment Instructions

To run the example, execute the following instructions.  This assumes use of Azure Cloud Shell.  If you are installing into your own environment, you will need to follow the [instructions to setup terraform for the Azure environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/terraform/terraform-install-configure).

1. browse to https://shell.azure.com

2. Specify your subscription by running this command with your subscription ID:  ```az account set --subscription YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID```.  You will need to run this every time after restarting your shell, otherwise it may default you to the wrong subscription, and you will see an error similar to `azurerm_public_ip.vm is empty tuple`.

3. get the terraform examples
```bash
mkdir tf
cd tf
git init
git remote add origin -f https://github.com/Azure/Avere.git
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "src/terraform/*" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin main
```

4. `cd src/terraform/examples/jumpbox172`

7. `code main.tf` to edit the local variables section at the top of the file, to customize to your preferences

8. execute `terraform init` in the directory of `main.tf`.

9. execute `terraform apply -auto-approve` to build the jumpbox

Once installed you will be able to login and use the jumpbox.

When you are done using the filer, you can destroy it by running `terraform destroy -auto-approve`.
