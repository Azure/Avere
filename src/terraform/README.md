# VFX and Animation Rendering with HPC Cache and Avere vFXT on Azure

To meet tight deadlines and reduce total cost of ownership (TCO), VFX and Animation studios use Azure for on-demand access to compute capacity for their render workloads.  Avere technology enables the cloud burst rendering scenario and makes it easy to extend an on-premises rendering pipeline to Azure with minimal workflow changes.

Customers burst render to Azure for the main reasons of controlling and tracking costs, security, ease of use, and collaboration.  The [Azure rendering white paper](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/visual-effects-and-animation-rendering-in-azure/) goes into detail on each of these topics.

The common cloud burst rendering architecture is shown in the following diagram:

![Burst Rendering Architecture](burstrenderarchitecture.png)

There are 4 major cloud infrastructure components that make up a cloud rendering solution:
1. **Network connection** - the burst rendering solution is connected via an [Azure Virtual Private Network (VPN) Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) or an [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/expressroute/).
1. **Custom Image** - customers create a linux or Windows based custom image that contains the necessary rendering and render management software to mount the storage cache and also connect to on-premises services such as a render manager, AD server, and metrics server.
1. **Storage Cache** - a managed HPC Cache or Avere vFXT is used to cache data, and hide latency to on-premises data.
1. **Render Farm** - Virtual Machine Scalesets are used to scale the custom image across thousands of virtual machines.  Additionally [Azure Cycle Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-cyclecloud/) is used to help manage the virtual machine scale-sets.

To get started the recommended approach is to follow the [First Render Pilot](examples/securedimage/Azure%20First%20Render%20Pilot.pdf).  The first render pilot provides a phased approach to  build out the burst rendering architecture on Azure.  The resources below will help you through each of the phases.

## Rendering Best Practices for Azure Compute, Network, and Storage

The highest priority for VFX and Animation Studios is the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO).  The following best practices supplement existing Azure documentation with guidance on how to achieve the lowest TCO.

1. [Best Practices for a New Subscription](examples/new-subscription) - it may be useful for a studio to create a subscription for each office, or each new show to separate out billing.  If this is the case, we recommend creating a one-time process described in this document.
1. [Best Practices for using Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) or Azure Cycle Cloud for Rendering](examples/vmss-rendering)
1. [Networking Best Practices for Rendering](examples/network-rendering)

1. [Support Best Practices for Rendering](support.md) - describes what to do when you encounter an issue on Azure.

## Storage Cache Infrastructure

Both HPC Cache and Avere vFXT for Azure provide file caching for high-performance computing (HPC).  We recommend to always choose HPC Cache for greater user manageability and only choose Avere vFXT for Azure for custom scenarios where HPC is unable to fit.  If you need to use Avere vFXT for Azure because of a missing feature in HPC Cache, please submit an issue so we can track and add to HPC Cache.
