# Avere vFXT

The Avere vFXT is an enterprise-scale clustered file system built for the cloud. It provides scalability, flexibility, and easy access to data stored in the cloud, in a datacenter, or both. High-performance computing workloads are supported with automatic hot data caching close to Azure Compute resources.  To learn more please visit the [Avere vFXT documentation page](http://aka.ms/averedocs).

## Tutorials

These tutorials help you understand cluster performance testing and common use-case tasks.

  * [VFX and Animation Rendering with HPC Cache and Avere vFXT on Azure](src/terraform) - Use HPC Cache or Avere vFXT as part of your burst rendering architecture.  This document describes the cloud burst rendering architecture and how to build out the infrastructure using Terraform examples, modules, and a provider.
  * [Virtual Machine Client Implementations that mount the Avere vFXT Edge Filer](docs/clients.md) - This tutorial discusses how to deploy and mount 3 types of virtual machines: loose VMs, VM availability sets (VMAS), and VM scale sets (VMSS).
  * [Measure HPC Cache or vFXT performance with vdbench](docs/vdbench.md) - Deploys vdbench on an *N*-node cluster to demonstrate the storage performance characteristics of the HPC Cache or Avere vFXT cluster
  * [Data Ingestor](docs/data_ingestor.md) - This tutorial implements a data ingestor containing the tools required to efficiently load data onto the Avere vFXT Edge Filer.
  * [Rendering using Azure Batch and HPC Cache or Avere vFXT](docs/maya_azure_batch_avere_vfxt_demo.md) - Demonstrates how to use the Autodesk Maya Renderer with Azure Batch and the HPC Cache or the Avere vFXT cluster to generate a rendered movie.
  * [Why use the HPC Cache or Avere vFXT for Rendering?](docs/why_avere_for_rendering.md) - Shows the results of rending against NFS at various latencies and how HPC Cache or the Avere vFXT hides the latency.
  * [Best Practices for Improving Azure Virtual Machine (VM) Boot Time](docs/azure_vm_provision_best_practices.md) - The Avere vFXT is commonly used with burstable compute workloads. We hear from our customers that it is very challenging to boot thousands of Azure virtual machines quickly. This article describes best practices for booting thousands of VMs in the fastest possible time.
  * [Windows 10 workstation for Avere vFXT](docs/windows_10_avere_vfxt_mounted_workstation.md) - Creates a Windows workstation within the same VNET as the Avere vFXT and automatically mounts the vFXT cluster and installs various Azure tools for debugging.
  * [Transfer Custom VM Image from GCE to Azure](docs/customImageTransfer_GCE2Azure.md) - A guide on directly transferring your custom VM image from GCE to Azure.
